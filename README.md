# Tambourine Story
> WWDC2024 Swift Student Challenge Distinguished Winner

Tambourine Story is my tribute to music and collaboration — how each and every one of us are able to be a part of something greater than ourselves, through collaborative art, through playing together — no matter who we are, we can be a part of something special. To me, that is the human nature of love and community, of yearning for arts and harmony.

Created using SwiftUI for iPadOS.

You can watch a demo of the gameplay [here](https://youtu.be/JkfIeaVxpj8).
